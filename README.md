Created as part of learning path:
Create web apps and services with ASP.NET Core, minimal API, and .NET

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/aspnet-core-minimal-api/

In this module, I learned how to create an API by using the minimal 
API template for .NET 6.

Minimal API enables you to create an API with only a few lines of code. 
It has all the major features that you're used to like dependency 
injection, talking to databases, and route management. A minimal API 
differs from a controller-based API because you explicitly specify the 
routes you need instead of relying on a convention-based approach like 
with a controller-based API.

There are many benefits to this approach:

Easier to get started: With four lines of code, you can have an API up and running quickly.

Progressive enhancement: Add features when you need them. Until then, 
your program code stays small. .NET 6 latest features: Use all the 
latest features from .NET 6 like top-level statements and records.

As part of this module, you learned how to add Swagger. You also added 
routes to create, read, update, and delete a resource.
