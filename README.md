Created as part of learning path:
Use a database with minimal API, Entity Framework Core, and ASP.NET Core

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/build-web-api-minimal-database/

In this module, I learned to add a database to a minimal API 
application with .NET 6 by using Entity Framework (EF) Core.

EF Core is an easy way to manage data in .NET applications. It's a 
lightweight, object-oriented, object-relational mapper that provides a 
high-level abstraction over the database. In this module, you used 
SQLite. You can also use other database providers like MySQL, 
PostgreSQL, and Microsoft SQL Server.

Minimal API enables you to create an API with only a few lines of code. 
It has all the major features that you're used to like dependency 
injection, talking to databases, and route management. A minimal API 
differs from a controller-based API because you explicitly specify the 
routes you need instead of relying on a convention-based approach like 
with a controller-based API.

There are many benefits to this approach:

Easier to get started: With four lines of code, you can have an API up and running quickly.

Progressive enhancement: Add features when you need them. Until then, 
your program code stays small. .NET 6 latest features: Use all the 
latest features from .NET 6 like top-level statements and records.

As part of this module, I learned how to add Swagger. I also added 
routes to create, read, update, and delete a resource.
